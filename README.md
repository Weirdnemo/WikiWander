# Wikipedia Speedrun

This project is a Next.js application that implements a speedrun game based on navigating between Wikipedia pages. The goal is to reach a target Wikipedia page starting from a random one, by only clicking on links within the articles, in the shortest amount of time. The application uses Firebase for backend services and incorporates some AI features, specifically for generating hints during the game.

## Features

* **Speedrun Gameplay:** Navigate Wikipedia pages against the clock.
* **Firebase Integration:** Likely used for user authentication, storing game data (scores, game history), and potentially other backend functionalities.
* **AI-Powered Hints:** Get helpful hints generated by AI to assist in finding the target page.
* **Next.js Framework:** Provides a performant and scalable foundation for the web application.
